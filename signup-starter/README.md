# Angular + Spring Boot Signup Starter (Google & Outlook OAuth)

This is a minimal starter project demonstrating:
- Angular signup page with "Continue with Google" and "Continue with Outlook" buttons.
- Spring Boot backend with Spring Security OAuth2 client configuration.

**Notes**
- Replace OAuth client IDs/secrets in `springboot/src/main/resources/application.yml`.
- This is a starter template — further work needed for production readiness (CORS, sessions, JWT, user persistence).
